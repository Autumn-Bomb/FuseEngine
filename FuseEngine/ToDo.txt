Refactor: 

Bugs:
1) Fix an issue with the framebuffer not resizing when a viewport is resized (if(m_FBO != 0) DeleteCurrentBuffer and call InitialiseFramebuffer) (DONE)
2) Camera doesn't resize to fit current Scene viewport size

Features:
1) Create a spriteRenderer class used to render multiple sprites at the same time (DONE)
2) Create a separate camera class for the editor camera, this way to game viewport only sees what the game camera sees
